# openseeface-gd
A Godot 3.x plugin for bringing [OpenSeeFace](https://github.com/emilianavt/OpenSeeFace) tracking data into Godot.

## IMPORTANT If you are looking for the VTuber application that was previously named `openseeface-gd`, that has been moved to [puppeteer](https://github.com/virtual-puppet-project/puppeteer) as to not conflict with [OpenSeeFace](https://github.com/emilianavt/OpenSeeFace).

## Usage as a Virtual Puppet Project extension (Windows)
1. Clone this repo
2. Download the latest [OpenSeeFace](https://github.com/emilianavt/OpenSeeFace) release
3. Find the binary folder (the folder that contains the compiled binary) and the models folder (called `models`)
4. Rename the binary folder to `OpenSeeFace`
5. Copy both folders to to `open_see_face/OpenSeeFaceFolder/<your folders here>`
6. The entire `open_see_face` folder can now be used as a Virtual Puppet Project extension

## FAQ

### Why did you move the VTuber application to [puppeteer](https://github.com/virtual-puppet-project/puppeteer)?
The initial release was more of a curiosity for me, as I wanted to see how hard it would be to track anything at all from within Godot. One thing led to another and the little test project eventually grew into an actual application.

I regret delaying the name change for as long as I did, and I apologize for the confusion this might have caused since the projects are only related by face tracker dependency.
